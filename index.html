  <h2>El Nido Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    A beach town in Palawan is called El Nido. El Nido is made up of 45 islands and islets. There are also limestone cliffs here that create a karst backdrop akin to those in Ha Long Bay, Krabi, and Guilin. Despite being a well-liked vacation spot for locals over the lengthy Holy Week holidays, it has not received much attention from foreign visitors.

  <h2>Chocolate Hills</h2>
  <p>
    The center of the Philippine island of Bohol is home to a collection of oddly formed hills known as the Chocolate Hills. This tiny island is the only place with such an incredible landscape. The number of chocolate hills is unknown. There are at least 1268 hills known to exist; however, some estimates place the number as high as 1776. The tallest hill, which is not particularly large, is only about 120 meters high.

  <h2>Undergroud River</h2>
  <p>
    The breathtaking limestone karst mountain scenery and cave system of the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park are well known. The park's stunning stalactites, stalagmites, and a number of sizable chambers never cease to astound visitors. The river itself weaves its way through 8.2 km of the 24 km-long tunnel system that extends beneath the mountains. Prior to the 2007 discovery of an underground river in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River was thought to be the longest underground river in the world.

  <h2>Banaue Rice Terraces</h2>
  <p>
    Many Filipinos rank the Banaue Rice Terraces as the eighth natural wonder of the world and as a national cultural treasure of the Philippines. The terraces in the Ifugao Mountains were almost certainly created by hand. Since more than 2,000 years ago, there have been rice terraces in the hilly areas of Ifugao and northern Luzon Island.

  <p>
    The caldera system on southern Luzon Island includes Taal, a mountain range in the Philippines. Eruptions have been documented since 3,580 BCE.
